Note:
- Favour Composition over Inheritance
- Separation of Concerns
- Information Hiding Principle
- Tell, donÂ´t ask! (High cohesion)
- Dependency injection
- SOLID principles!!!
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open Closed Principle: software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle: many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
- Dependency Inversion Principle: one should depend upon abstractions, not concretions
