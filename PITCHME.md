## Why Go?

- Progamming language developed by Google, published since November 2009 |
- Automatic memory management (garbage collection) (as opposed to C or C++) |
- Single static binary as result (as opposed to JVM and interpreted languages) |
- Java developers strive for a 10 minute build; Go developers get angry about a 10 second build |
- Garbage collection guaranteed to block for less than 1 ms (as opposed to JVM) |
- Go is free of magic and everybody strives for simplicity |

- Cloud technology (Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, ...) |
- FinTech (solarisBank, Barzahlen, Fraugster, OptioPay, ...) |

- SOLID principles!!!
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open Closed Principle: software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle: many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
- Dependency Inversion Principle: one should depend upon abstractions, not concretions
