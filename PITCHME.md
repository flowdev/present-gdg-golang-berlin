## What is Go?

- It uses safe pointers (without pointer arithmetic) |
- It has garbage collection (as opposed to C or C++) |
- Simple syntax between C and Java with some simple extensions |

## Why Go?

- Single static binary as result (as opposed to JVM and interpreted languages) |
- Java developers strive for a 10 minute build; Go developers get angry about a 10 second build |
- Garbage collection guaranteed to block for less than 1 ms (as opposed to JVM) |
- Go is free of magic and everybody strives for simplicity |
